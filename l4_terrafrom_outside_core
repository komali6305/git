When Michael finds out, he decided he wants to manage the new EC2 instance using Terraform moving forward. He opens his terminal and types:

$ terraform import aws_instance.web_app_42 i-b54a26b28b8acv7233

However, Terraform returns the following error: Error: resource address "aws_instance.web_app_42" does not exist in the configuration.
