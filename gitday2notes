BRANCHES:
It's an individual line of development for code.
we create different branches in real-time.
each developer will work on their own branch.
At the end we will combine all branches together on GitHub.
Default branch is Master.
Common Branches: Master, Main, Release, Hot-fix -------
 

git branch        : to list the branches
git branch movies    : to create a new branch
git checkout movies    : to switch from one branch to another.
git checkout -b recharge: to create and switch from one branch to another.
git branch -m old new    : to rename a branch
git branch -D movies    : to delete a branch

we cant delete the current branch

PROCESS:

git branch        
git branch movies    
git checkout movies
touch movies{1..5}
git status
git add movies*
git commit -m "dev-1 commits" movies*


git remote add origin https://github.com/revathisiriki78/paytm.git

git status
git add dth*
git commit -m "dev-2 commits" dth*

git push origin dth

git checkout -b train
touch train{1..5}
git add train*
git commit -m "dev-3 commits" train*

git push origin train

git commit -m "dev-4 commits" recharge*

git push origin recharge

TO MERGE BRANCHES IN GITHUB WE NEED TO CREATE PULL REQUEST

PULL REQUEST -- > CREATE NEW PULL REQUEST -- > SELECT MOVIES -- > CREATE --> MERGE -- > CONFIRM


GIT MERGE: it will merge files blw two different branches

git checkout master
git merge movies
git merge train


GIT REBASE: used to add files blw two different branches
git checkout master
git rebase dth
git rebase recharge


MERGE VS REBASE:
merge for public repos, rebase for private
merge stores history, rebase will not store the entire history
merge will show files, rebase will not show files


in GitHub we use Pull Request (PR) to do merging.


GIT REVERT: used to revert(get back) the files we merge.
to undo merge we can use revert.

git revert dth
git revert recharge
